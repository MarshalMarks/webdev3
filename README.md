# Web Development 3 (APIs + Databases) Example

## Info

This is the example webpage written for the Web Development 3 workshop given at the UTA Central Library on December 4th. If you would like to review the workshop slideshow, you can do so at [this link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SoF5b31Q3hvhP8thDnG9goIU24zunDV2dLjGp41Cve0/edit?usp=sharing).

Feel free to download the files and mess around with them to get a better understanding of the Express API library and sqlite3.

As a reminder: HTML, CSS, and Javascript files can be opened in any plaintext editor or IDE (integrated development environment), and the API can be run in a terminal when Node is installed.

## Basic Setup Instructions

1. Download the zip file from the GitHub page or clone the directory to your local machine.
2. Extract the zip file on your local machine.
3. Download and install Node from [this link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).
5. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
6. Type "node -v" in terminal to verify that Node is installed properly.
7. Type "npm install" in terminal to install all node modules and dependencies.
8. Type "npm start" in terminal to run the API.
9. In the frontend folder, open index.html with your web browser of choice.

## More Learning Resources

This workshop should act as a springboard to lay down the basics of APIs and databases, but there is so much more that I was not able to cover in an hour. Here are some additional resources to use if you'd like to learn more:
